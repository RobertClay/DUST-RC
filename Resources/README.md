## Good Programming Practice

### [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/)
 - A book with lots of brilliant examples of "good" and "bad" code.
 - Try to read chapters 1-4. If possible, also read 5-6 and 9.
 - Worth a read if you want to get a better feel for writing clean, maintainable code.
 - The code examples  are written in Java but are very applicable to a lot of modern languages!

### [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

 - "This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill."
 - [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

### [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)

 - "A Software Carpentry workshop is taught by at least one trained and badged instructor. Over two days, instructors teach our three core topics: the Unix shell, version control with Git, and a programming language (Python or R). Curricula for these lessons in English and Spanish (select lessons only) are below."
 - _Leeds uni also runs this course occasionally_

### [Object-Oriented Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design)

 - A free Coursera course on object-orientation. 


## Working with Repositories

###Â [The seven rules of a great git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)

 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
 1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
 1. Capitalize the subject line
 1. Do not end the subject line with a period
 1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
 1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
 1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Language-specific resources

### Python

#### [PEP-8 Tutorial: Code Standards in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pep8-tutorial-python-code)

 - A beginner tutorial to Python's style guide "so that you can start formatting your code correctly to maximize its readability!"
 - "Code is read much more often than it is written."

### R

 - [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) O'Reilly (e) book written by Hadley Wickham (who's probably the best known person for R data science).
 - [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) for making data visualisations
 - [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) for learning how to use R to work with spatial data.
 - [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) is great for making interactive maps
  - [Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) (_also recommended above in the 'good coding practice' section_).
