This project aims to develop a machine learning model to emulate an Agent-Based Model, in order to predict in real-time

The emulator is a representative of the ABM, that is much faster than the original ABM, and produce similar results to the ABM

We will evaluate the emulator with data generated from the ABM (no real data), so this is a pseudo-truth approach to this problem.
